# retreat_nametags
Generate name tags for retreats and save yourself some time.

Files you need to include in your folder:
  1. Lazy Gaga python file
  2. Excel spreadsheet with all of the labels you want to print (i.e. Name, LIFEgroup, housing information, keyholder, etc.)
  3. JPEG background image
  4. TTF files for each font 
  
Running on the command line:
  $ python Lazy\ Gaga.py
  $ ./Lazy\ Gaga.py
  
Do something cool with all the time you saved!
